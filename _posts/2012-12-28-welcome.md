In this Installation Guide, I will explain my default Setup for ArchLinux with LUKS Drive-Encryption and EFI.

You can follow the full installation guide and choose a desktop environment to install.

For a much simpler installation using a Desktop Environment from a Live Arch Linux OS, feel free to use my Prebuild Arch Linux Live IMAGES on SourceForge.
