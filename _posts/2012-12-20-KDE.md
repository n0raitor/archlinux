> KDE Plasma is a lightweight and visually appealing desktop environment for Linux that comes with tons of customization options at a very detailed level. The latest iteration of this desktop is Plasma 5 which is based on Qt5, KDE Framework 5 provides both Xorg and Wayland display server options.

**Install Packages**
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed xorg sddm
sudo pacman -S --needed plasma kde-applications
```

**Enable display server and network**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

**Configure sddm and reboot**
One last configuration you need for the KDE Plasma desktop is related to the login screen. By default, sddm uses its own failsafe login screen and that is not the typical KDE Plasma “breeze” login screen. A small tweak is needed for a KDE Plasma login screen.

Open the sddm.conf file from the terminal.
```bash
sudo nano /usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/default.conf
```
Change the theme section as per below.
```bash
[Theme]
# current theme name
 Current=breeze
```

Press CTRL+O and CTRL+X to save and exit the nano editor. Now you can restart your Arch system using -

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

And you should be greeted with a nice KDE Plasma login screen and a desktop.
