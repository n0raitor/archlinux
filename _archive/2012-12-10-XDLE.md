##### Configuration for Login Managers

###### GDM or KDM

No manual configuration is needed. Just select LXDE from the available sessions listed by the display manager. If you don't see LXDE, restart your gdm or kdm, or reboot.

###### SLIM

With this display manager, some manual configuration is needed. Please refer to their  [official document](http://slim.berlios.de/manual.php)  and write your /etc/slim.conf and ~/.xinitrc. The command you should put in your ~/.xinitrc to start LXDE is:
```bash
exec startlxde
```
###### XDM

Put this line at the end of "~/.xinitrc".
```bash
exec startlxde
```
Be sure to comment all other entries.

###### No display manager, use startx

Put this line at the end of "~/.xinitrc" or "/etc/X11/Xsession".
```bash
exec startlxde
```
